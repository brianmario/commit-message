# Commit Message Editor

This is a tiny, fast commit message editor.

It has a subject line and a body field. Ideally it will eventually support
GitHub-flavored markdown syntax (with autocompleters). But, you gotta start
somewhere.

It looks like this:

## Usage

`git config --global core.editor commit-message`

Then every time you commit, leave off `-m` and let this modal help you fill out
your commit message.
